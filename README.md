# Web-Scraping
Module 11 Challenge 
This challenge focused on scraping specific elements from Mars News. Using Splinter, we accessed the website's HTML directly in our Jupyter notebook, and with Beautiful Soup, we created an object to extract titles and preview texts. We stored these in a list as dictionaries. In part two, we followed a similar process with Splinter and Beautiful Soup, then used Pandas to create a DataFrame for column manipulation and analysis. After processing the data, we created visualizations by plotting the edited DataFrames and saved the final DataFrame as a CSV file.
